Hey (hey), I'm your life
I'm the one who takes you there
Hey (hey), I'm your life
I'm the one who cares
They (they), they betray
I'm your only true friend now
They (they), they'll betray
I'm forever there
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
Sad but true
You (you), you're my mask
You're my cover, my shelter
You (you), you're my mask
You're the one who's blamed
Do (do), do my work
Do my dirty work, scapegoat
Do (do), do my deeds
For you're the one who's shamed
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your dream, mind astray
I'm your eyes while you're away
I'm your pain while you repay
You know it's sad but true
Sad but true
I'm your dream, I'm your eyes
I'm your pain
I'm your dream (I'm your dream)
I'm your eyes (I'm your eyes)
I'm your pain (I'm your pain)
You know it's sad but true
Hate (hate), I'm your hate
I'm your hate when you want love
Pay (pay), pay the price
Pay for nothing's fair
Hey (hey), I'm your life
I'm the one who took you there
Hey (hey), I'm your life
And I no longer care
I'm your dream, make you real
I'm your eyes when you must steal
I'm your pain when you can't feel
Sad but true
I'm your truth, telling lies
I'm your reasoned alibis
I'm inside, open your eyes
I'm you
Sad but true
It's like you're a drug
It's like you're a demon I can't face down
It's like I'm stuck
It's like I'm running from you all the time
And I know I let you have all the power
It's like the only company I seek is misery all around
It's like you're a leech
Sucking the life from me
It's like I can't breathe
Without you inside of me
And I know I let you have all the power
And I realize I'm never gonna quit you over time
It's like I can't breathe
It's like I can't see anything
Nothing but you
I'm addicted to you
It's like I can't think
Without you interrupting me
In my thoughts, in my dreams
You've taken over me
It's like I'm not me
It's like I'm not me
It's like I'm lost
It's like I'm giving up slowly
It's like you're a ghost that's haunting me
Leave me alone
And I know these voices in my head
Are mine alone
And I know I'll never change my ways
If I don't give you up now
It's like I can't breathe
It's like I can't see anything
Nothing but you
I'm addicted to you
It's like I can't think
Without you interrupting me
In my thoughts, in my dreams
You've taken over me
It's like I'm not me
It's like I'm not me
I'm hooked on you, I need a fix, I can't take it
Just one more hit, I promise I can deal with it
I'll handle it, quit it, just one more time, then that's it
Just a little bit more to get me through this
I'm hooked on you, I need a fix, I can't take it
Just one more hit, I promise I can deal with it
I'll handle it, quit it, just one more time, then that's it
Just a little bit more to get me through this
It's like I can't breathe
It's like I can't see anything
Nothing but you
I'm addicted to you
It's like I can't think
Without you interrupting me
In my thoughts, in my dreams
You've taken over me
It's like I'm not me
It's like I'm not me.
Speak to me, I will follow
I heard you call my name
Lying on the bathroom floor
No one here to blame
There's a message I know can be found
I'm listening, I hear you, your sound
Speak to me in a language
That I can understand
Tell me that you're listening
Give me some kind of plan
Give me something, you'd be my drug of choice
You lead me, I follow, your voice
I will disappoint you
I will let you down
I need to know you're here with me
Turn it all around
I'd be grateful, I'd follow you around
I'm listening, I'm here now, I'm found
Like anyone would be
I am flattered by your fascination with me
Like any hot-blooded woman
I have simply wanted an object to crave
But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight
Must be strangely exciting
To watch the stoic squirm
Must be somewhat heartening
To watch shepherd need shepherd
But you, you're not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight
Like any uncharted territory
I must seem greatly intriguing
You speak of my love like
You have experienced love like mine before
But this is not allowed
You're uninvited
An unfortunate slight
I don't think you unworthy
I need a moment to deliberate
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
So close, no matter how far
It couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know
I never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words, I don't just say
And nothing else matters
Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us something new
Open mind for a different view
And nothing else matters
Never cared for what they say
Never cared for games they play
Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
And I know, yeah, yeah
So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
No, nothing else matters
The end
The songwriter?s dead
The blade fell upon him
Taking him to the white lands
Of Empathica,
Of Innocence
Empathica
Innocence
The dreamer and the wine
Poet without a rhyme
A widowed writer, torn apart by chains of Hell
One last perfect verse
Yet still the same old song
Oh Christ, how I hate what I have become
Take me home
Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for God save me
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
My home was there and then
These meadows of heaven
Adventure-filled days
One with every smiling face
Please, no more words
Thoughts from a severed head
No more praise
Tell me once my heart goes right
Take me home
Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for God save me
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Whore for the cold world
Sparkle my scenery
With turquoise waterfall
With beauty underneath
The Ever Free
Tuck me in
Beneath the blue
Beneath the pain
Beneath the rain
Goodnight kiss for a child in time
Swaying blade my lullaby
On the shore we sat and hoped
Under the same pale moon
Whose guiding light chose you
Chose you all
I?m afraid, so afraid, of being raped
Again and again and again
I know I will die alone, but loved
You live long enough to hear the sound of guns
Long enough to find yourself screaming every night
And if you want
Live long enough to see your friends betray you
Years have I been strapped unto this altar
Now I only have three minutes and counting
I just wish the tide would catch me first
And give me a death
I always longed for
Second robber to the right of Christ
Cut in half - infacticide
The world will rejoice today
As the crows feast on the rotting poet
Everyone must bury their own
No pack to bury the heart of stone
Now he's home in Hell, serves him well
Slain by the bell, tolling for his farewell
The morning dawned upon this altar
Remains of the dark passion play
Performed by his friends without shame
Spitting on his grave as they came
Get away, run away, fly away
Lead me astray, to dreamer?s hideaway
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, the whore for the cold world
Forgive me, I have but two faces
One for the world,
One for God save me
I cannot cry ?cause the shoulder cries more
I cannot die, I, a whore for the cold world
A whore for the cold world
A whore for the cold world
Today, in the year of our Lord, 2005
Thomas was called from the cares of the world
He stopped crying at the end of each beautiful day
The music he wrote had too long been without silence
He was found naked and dead
With a smile in his face, a pen and 1000 pages of erased text
Save me!
Be still, my son
You're home
Oh when did you become so cold?
The blade will keep on descending
All you need is to feel my love
Search for beauty, find your shore
Try to save them all, bleed no more
You have such ocean's within
In the end
I will always love you
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smouldering
Fundamental differing
Pure intention juxtaposed
Will set two lovers' souls in motion
Disintegrating as it goes
Testing our communication
The light that fueled our fire then
Has burned a hole between us so
We cannot seem to reach an end
Crippling our communication
I know the pieces fit
'Cause I watched them tumble down
No fault, none to blame
It doesn't mean I don't desire
To point the finger, blame the other
Watch the temple topple over
To bring the pieces back together
Rediscover communication
The poetry that comes from
The squaring off between
And the circling is worth it
Finding beauty in the dissonance
There was a time that the pieces fit
But I watched them fall away
Mildewed and smouldering
Strangled by our coveting
I've done the math enough to know
The dangers of our second guessing
Doomed to crumble unless we grow
And strengthen our communication
Cold silence has
A tendency to
Atrophy any
Sense of compassion
Between supposed lovers
Between supposed lovers
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
I know the pieces fit
And I know the pieces fit

Needles are piercing through my skin
I'll tell you the feeling what it's like
Is life just all about deception?
Please don't be a part of a fairy tale,
But you're so young to play with thy own will
Should I trade the breath of my life for freedom?
I'm calling you, dear
(Find the way) Can't you see me standing right here?
(Feel my pain) Life's bleeding from fear
(Find its place) I will give it straight from my vein
Needles are piercing through my skin
I don't fear the fucking life
This never meant I can't sit by
They say as if it takes me somewhere
Just let me swallow the faith by injection
Life better be rushing to my head, my love
I've played with this game before to find a piece of my true self!
I'm lost within!
I'm calling you, dear
(Find the way) Can't you see me standing right here?
(Feel my pain) Life's bleeding from fear
(Find its place) I will give it straight from my vein
I.V. in my vein
Do you feel where's it's vein
Can you stick with then mystery of the world,
And when it's so far from its blind?
Till the shape of shadows fade
Forever fade away
I'm calling you, dear.
Can't you see me standing right here?
Life's bleeding from fear.
I'll give it straight from my vein.
I'm calling you, dear
(Find the way) Can't you see me standing right here?
(Feel my pain) Life's bleeding from fear
(Find its place) I will give it straight from my vein
Black then white are all I see in my infancy
Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me
Lets me see
As below so above and beyond, I imagine
Drawn beyond the lines of reason
Push the envelope, watch it bend
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must
Feed my will to feel my moment, drawing way outside the lines
Black then white are all I see in my infancy
Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me
Lets me see
There is so much more
And beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities
As below so above and beyond, I imagine
Drawn outside the lines of reason
Push the envelope, watch it bend
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind
Withering my intuition leaving opportunities behind
Feed my will to feel this moment
Urging me to cross the line
Reaching out to embrace the random
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come
I embrace my desire to
I embrace my desire to
Feel the rhythm, to feel connected
Enough to step aside and weep like a widow
To feel inspired
To fathom the power
To witness the beauty
To bathe in the fountain
To swing on the spiral
To swing on the spiral to
Swing on the spiral
Of our divinity
And still be a human
With my feet upon the ground I lose myself
Between the sounds and open wide to suck it in
I feel it move across my skin
I'm reaching up and reaching out
I'm reaching for the random or whatever will bewilder me
Whatever will bewilder me
And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been
We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Spiral out, keep going
Look, I was gonna go easy on you, not to hurt your feeling's
But I'm only goin' to give (six minutes) this one chance (six minutes)
Something's wrong (six minutes), I can feel it (six minutes)
It's just (Slim Shady, you're on) a feelin' I've got (on)
Like somethin"s about to happen (on)
But I don't know what (six minutes, for six-)
If that means what I think it means (six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
We're in trouble, big trouble (on)
And if he is as bananas as you say (on)
I'm not takin' any chances
You are just what the doc ordered
I'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
They said I rap like a robot, so call me Rapbot
But for me to rap like a computer, it must be in my genes
I got a laptop in my back pocket
My pen'll go off when I half-cock it
Got a fat knot from that rap profit
Made a livin' and a killin' off it
Ever since Bill Clinton was still in office
With Monica Lewinsky feelin' on his nutsack
I'm an MC, still as honest
But as rude and as indecent as all hell
Syllables, skill-a-holic (kill 'em all with)
This flippity dippity-hippity hip-hop
You don't really wanna get into a pissin' match
With this rappity brat, packin' a MAC in the back of the Ac'
Backpack, rap crap, yap-yap, yackety-yack
And at the exact same time I attempt these lyrical acrobat stunts
While I'm practicin' that
I'll still be able to break a motherfuckin' table
Over the back of a couple of faggots and crack it in half
Realized it was ironic I was signed to Aftermath after the fact
How could I not blow? All I do is drop F-bombs
Feel my wrath of attack
Rappers are havin' a rough time period, here's a maxi pad
That could bleed disastrously bad, for the wack
While I'm masterfully constructin' this masterpiece (yeah)
'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
Now, who thinks their arms are long enough to slap box, slap box?
Let me show you maintainin' this shit ain't that hard, that hard
Everybody want the key and the secret to rap immortality
Like Ι have got
Well, to be truthful, the blueprint's
Simply rage and youthful exuberance
Everybody loves to root for a nuisance
Hit the Earth like an asteroid
And did nothin' but shoot for the moon since (pew!)
MCs get taken to school with this music
'Cause I use it as a vehicle to "Bus the rhyme"
Now I lead a new school full of students, me?
Me? I'm a product of Rakim, Lakim Shabazz, 2Pac
N.W.A, Cube, hey Doc, Ren
Yella, Eazy, thank you, they got Slim
Inspired enough to one day grow up
Blow up and be in a position
To meet Run-DMC, induct him
Into the motherfuckin' Rock and Roll Hall of Fame
Even though I'll walk in the church
And burst in a ball of flames
Only Hall of Fame I'll be inducted in is the
Alcohol of fame, on the wall of (shame)
You fags think it's all a game, 'til I walk a flock of flames
Off a plank, and tell me what in the fuck are you thinkin'?
Little gay-lookin' boy, so gay, I can barely say it with
A straight face, lookin' boy (ha)
You're witnessin' a mass-occur, like you're watchin' a church gatherin'
Take place, lookin' boy
"Oy vey, that boy's gay, " that's all
They say, lookin' boy
You get a thumbs up, pat on the back and a "Way to go" from your label
Every day, lookin' boy
Hey, lookin' boy! What you say, lookin' boy?
I get a, "Hell, yeah" (hell, yeah) from Dre, lookin' boy
I'ma work for him, everythin' I have, never asked nobody for shit
Get outta my face, lookin' boy
Basically, boy, you're never gonna be capable
Of keepin' up with the same pace, lookin' boy, 'cause
I'm beginnin' to feel like a rap god, rap god
All my people from the front to the back nod, back nod
The way I'm racin' around the track, call me NASCAR, NASCAR
Dale Earnhardt of the trailer park, the White Trash God
Kneel before General Zod, this planet's Krypton-
No, Asgard, Asgard
So, you'll be Thor and I'll be Odin
You rodent, I'm omnipotent
Let off then I'm reloadin'
Immediately with these bombs I'm totin'
And I should not be woken
I'm the walkin' dead, but I'm just a talkin' head
A zombie floatin'
But I got your mom deep-throatin'
I'm out my Ramen Noodle, we have nothin' in common, poodle
I'm a Doberman, pinch yourself in the arm and pay homage, pupil
It's me, my honesty's brutal
But it's honestly futile if I don't utilize what I do though
For good, at least once in a while, so I wanna make sure
Somewhere in this chicken scratch, I scribble and doodle
Enough rhymes to
Maybe try to help get some people through tough times
But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case
'Cause even you unsigned rappers
Are hungry lookin' at me like it's lunchtime
I know there was a time where once I was king of the underground
But I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind
So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine
Appeal with the skin color of mine and
You get too big and here they come tryin' to
Censor you like that one line I said
On "I'm Back" from The Mathers LP
One when I tried to say I'll
Take seven kids from Columbine
Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47
A revolver and 99
See if I get away with it now
That I ain't as big (now) as I was, but I'm
Morphin' into an immortal, comin' through the portal
You're stuck in a time warp from 2004 though
And I don't know what the fuck
That you rhyme for, you're pointless as Rapunzel
With fuckin' cornrows
You write normal? Fuck bein' normal
And I just bought a new raygun from the future
Just to come and shoot ya, like when Fabulous made Ray J mad
'Cause Math said he looked like a fag at Mayweather's pad
Singin' to a man while he played piano
Man, oh man, that was a 24-7 special
On the cable channel
So Ray J went straight to the radio station
The very next day
"Hey Fab, I'ma kill you"
Lyrics comin' at you at supersonic speed (J.J. Fad)
Uh, summa-lumma, dooma-lumma, you assumin' I'm a human
What I gotta do to get it through to you? I'm superhuman
I'm innovative and I'm made of rubber so that anythin'
You say is ricochetin' off of me, and it'll glue to you and
I'm devastatin', more than ever demonstratin'
How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feelin' like it's levitatin'
Never fadin', and I know the haters are forever waitin'
For the day that they can say I fell off, they'll be celebratin'
'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated
I make elevatin' music, you make elevator music
"Oh, he's too mainstream"
Well, that's what they do when they get jealous, they confuse it
"It's not hip-hop, it's pop"
'Cause I found a hella way to fuse it
With rock, shock rap with Doc
Throw on "Lose Yourself" and make 'em lose it
"I don't know how to make songs like that
I don't know what words to use"
Let me know when it occurs to you
While I'm rippin' any one of these verses that versus you
It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you
How many verses I gotta murder to
Prove that if you were half as nice your songs
You could sacrifice virgins too?
Ugh, school flunky, pill junkie
But look at the accolades these skills brung me
Full of myself, but still hungry
I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to
When I'm a million leagues above you
Ill when I speak in tongues
But it's still tongue-in-cheek, fuck you, I'm drunk
So, Satan, take the fuckin' wheel, I'ma sleep in the front seat
Bumpin' Heavy D and the Boyz, still "Chunky but Funky"
But in my head, there's somethin' I can feel
Tuggin' and strugglin', angels fight with devils and
Here's what they want from me
They're askin' me to eliminate some of the women hate
But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred
I have, then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic
To the situation, understand the discrimination
But fuck it, life's handin' you lemons?
Make lemonade then
But if I can't batter the women
How the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake, then?
Don't mistake him for (Satan)
It's a fatal mistake if you think
I need to be overseas and take a vacation
To trip a broad, and make her fall on her face and
Don't be a retard
Be a king, think not
Why be a king
When you can be a god?
Big cheese piling, you speed dialing
you talk shit, but I keep smiling
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage
That's your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge
You glad when I never had shit but mad I got it
Niggas wanna turn their back (spine)
She don't wanna fuck no more (fine)
I'ma be that nigga some day (time)
Lost a couple friends along the way (crime)
Even in the end you could never end me
Still in the hood and I still sip tea
When I go in, I'ma go for the win
On point like syringe and it's like that
Living life full of sin, gotta cup full of Hen'
Put my tears in a pen and I write back
Ice pack cause' my heart lost
I'm so cold that I Jack Frost
I'm 'bout be on the upper echelon
Niggas gonna hate on the man that I become
Big cheese piling, you speed dialing
you talk shit, but I keep smiling
That's your chick, but not my chick
'Cause she got mileage
That's your head, but not my head
'Cause I drop knowledge
You glad when I never had shit but mad I got it
Niggas wanna take my life (stripes)
Police never read my rights (right)
Only wanna fuck me for the fame (hype)
Another rapper hit it in the same (night)
Niggas ain't shit and the hoes ain't loyal
Really gonna hate when they can't destroy you
Then expect the royal treatment
Talkin' slick like it's oil speakin'
Down to earth, 'til my soil weaken
Venomous words, watching the poison leakin'
Bandana on my motherfuckin' face
.38 on my motherfuckin' waist
When you see me better man up
Better make like a roller coaster put your hands up
Big cheese piling, you speed dialing
you talk shit, but I keep smiling
That's your chick, but not my chick,
'Cause she got mileage
That's your head, but not my head,
'Cause I drop knowledge
Mad I got it
Mad I got it
Hate the government, capital punishment
I keep a heater on my hip, don't need an oven mitt
I'm on some other shit, mind is twisted
I wear this mask every day, Stanley Ipkiss
Realistic views, a pessimistic blues
I sing along, who's got me on my crip shit
Lipstick, long kiss from the devil lips
Moonlit, two hits from the cannabis
Death knocking at my door, who could it be?
Life not sweet like suit wit' an E
Try to read me, would it be, Stephen King
Big cheese only bring me Misery
Insane with no brain, I'm low zane
No fame and no thangs is so strange
Do things that I don't see violent
Stick a nigga up because I'm mad he got it
Got it, got it
'Cause I'm mad he got it,
Got it
Let go and beg for freedom
Another row jumping into the flame
Loose lips are shifting leaders
From here on out everyone is to blame
I'm looking up to my company
A full blown artillery
Keep the sights on the enemy
And bust the lid off anarchy
Your condescending demeanor has all gone wrong
Figured you should have known this all along
We're not numbers we're free, we're so alive (so alive)
'Cause the day we give in is the day we die (the day we die)
Behold, a credo wavering
A sleight of hand is the dogma they preach
Beneath, a conscience's fading
To even out all your steady beliefs
Stand your ground in the battle zone
Filled with life, bone and scorn
Clench your fists, I'm battle prone
Pull the trigger and set the tone
Your condescending demeanor has all gone wrong
Figured you should have known this all along
We're not numbers we're free, we're so alive (so alive)
'Cause the day we give in is the day we die (the day we die)
Pull that trigger
Fuck all your wicked corruption
It's been there since our inception, but we couldn't see
All the times we've felt so hollow
As our hopes were hanged in gallows
All this time we've been locked away
And there was nothing left to say
Until today
We're not numbers we're free, we're so alive (so alive)
'Cause the day we give in is the day we die (the day we die)

Born on life support, I can see my glory shining in the distance.
They finally rest, all my bravest and best, when I drag my immaculate flesh to the summit.
What more can be done? Laid waste to my every rival.
Oh so tough when you huff the stench of survival.
When will all this end? Just admit I am your idol.
Will I cease this? 30 pieces? Upon my revival?
No fucking way,
Cut out our tongues and we still won't obey.
Ask the betrayed,
If your life's in my hand I can clench it away.
All will pay.
Course you know that routine, reputation demeaned, bought yourself some esteem.
Gold and green.
A plebeian smokescreen, as you prance and you preen, nothing's stopping this oil-less machine.
Should I just fade into legend before I'm revered?
I guess that's what they want when your name invokes fear.
Lynch made coffin birth, I was spat into the dirt.
Everything I've earned, was exactly what it's worth.
My actions concur with the deafening words,
Expected to swallow the bullshit you serve.
What more can be done? Laid waste to my every rival.
Oh so tough when you huff the stench of survival.
When will all this end? Just admit I am your idol.
Will I cease this? 30 pieces? Upon my revival?
Impending.
Dominance.
Infamous.
Prominence.
As I walk on the friends and the foes I have slain, I finally ascend to my throne.
Middle digit on the hand of God, the final letter in Man's tombstone.
Cut out our tongues and we still won't obey.
This world's in my hand I can clench it away.
You look like an angel (look like an angel)
Walk like an angel (walk like an angel)
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh, yes, you are, devil in disguise
You fooled me with your kisses
You cheated and you schemed
Heaven knows how you lied to me
You're not the way you seemed
You look like an angel (look like an angel)
Walk like an angel (walk like an angel)
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh, yes, you are, devil in disguise
I thought that I was in heaven
But I was sure surprised
Heaven help me, I didn't see
The devil in your eyes
You look like an angel (look like an angel)
Walk like an angel (walk like an angel)
Talk like an angel
But I got wise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh, yes, you are, devil in disguise
You're the devil in disguise
Oh, yes, you are, devil in disguise
Oh, yes, you are, devil in disguise
Oh, yes, you are, devil in disguise
Oh, yes, you are, devil in disguise
Daylight
I wake up feelin' like you won't play right
I used to know, but now that shit don't feel right
It made me put away my pride
So long
You made a nigga wait for some, so long
You make it hard for boy like that to go on
I'm wishin' I could make this mine, oh
yeah
(You can have it) oh, oh, oh
(If you need it) ooh
(We can make it, oh)
If you want it
You can have it
But stay woke, niggas creepin'
They gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh
Now stay woke, niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes
Too late
You wanna make it right, but now it's too late
My peanut butter chocolate cake with Kool-Aid
I'm tryin' not to waste my time
oh
(You can have it) you can have it
(If you need it) you better believe in somethin'
(We can make it, oh)
If you want it
(You can have it) ah
But stay woke (stay woke, stay woke), niggas creepin' (they be creepin')
They gon' find you (they gon' find you)
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh (gon' catch you sleepin', put your hands up now, baby)
Now stay woke, niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes, but stay woke (ooh-ah)
Niggas creepin' (they gon' find you), they gon' find you
Gon' catch you sleepin', ooh (gon' catch you, gon' catch you)
Now stay woke, niggas creepin'
Now, don't you close your eyes
How'd it get so scandalous?
Oh, how'd it get so scandalous?
Oh, oh, baby, how'd it get
How'd it get so scandalous?
How'd it get so scandalous?
But stay woke
But stay woke
Welcome to where time stands still
No one leaves and no one will
Moon is full, never seems to change
Just labelled mentally deranged
Dream the same thing every night
I see our freedom in my sight
No locked doors, no windows barred
No things to make my brain seem scarred
Sleep my friend, and you will see
The dream is my reality
They keep me locked up in this cage
Can't they see it's why my brain says rage?
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone
Build my fear of what's out there
Cannot breathe the open air
Whisper things into my brain
Assuring me that I'm insane
They think our heads are in their hands
But violent use brings violent plans
Keep him tied, it makes him well
He's getting better, can't you tell?
No more can they keep us in
Listen, damn it, we will win
They see it right, they see it well
But they think this saves us from our hell
Sanitarium
Leave me be
Sanitarium
Just leave me alone
Sanitarium
(Just leave me alone)
Fear of living on
Natives getting restless now
Mutiny in the air
Got some death to do
Mirror stares back hard
Kill, it's such a friendly word
Seems the only way
For reaching out again
You could've been all I wanted
But you weren't honest
Now get in the ground
You choked off the surest of favors
But if you really loved me
You would've endured my world
Well, if you're just as I presumed
A whore in sheep's clothing
Fucking up all I do
Yeah, and if so, here we stop
Then never again
Will you see this in your life
Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs
You stormed off to scar the armada
Like Jesus played letter
I'll drill through your hands
The stone for the curse you have blamed me
With love and devotion, I'll die as you sleep
But if you could just write me out
To neverless wonder... happy will I become
Be true that this is no option
So with sin I condemn you
Demon play, demon out!
Hang on to the glory at my right hand
Here laid to rest is our love ever longed
With truth on the shores of compassion
You seem to take premise to all of these songs
One last kiss for you
One more wish to you
Please make up your mind girl...
I'd do anything for you
One last kiss for you
One more wish to you
Please make up your mind girl...
Before I hope you die
Here I lay
Still and breathless
Just like always
Still, I want some more
Mirrors sideways
Who cares what's behind?
Just like always
Still your passenger
Chrome buttons, buckles and leather surfaces
These and other lucky witnesses
Now to calm me
This time won't you please
Drive faster
Roll the window down this
Cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees anything?
I'm your passenger
I'm your passenger
Drop these down
Then put them on me
Nice, cool seats
There to cushion your knees
Now to calm me
Take me around again
Don't pull over
This time won't you please
Drive faster
Roll the window down this
Cool night air is curious
Let the whole world look in
Who cares who sees what tonight?
Roll these misty windows
Down to catch my breath and then
Go and go and go just
Drive me home and back again
Here I lay
Just like always
Don't let me
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Take me to the edge
Get on your knees and bow down
Yeah, I come alive, I'll survive, take on anything
So paint a target on my back let 'em come for me
I don't fall, don't quit, don't ever sleep
'Cause, I'm on another level that you'll never reach
If you seek forgiveness
You'll get nothing, you'll get nothing from me
You will never know, it's the price I pay
Look into my eyes, we are not the same
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
'Cause I'm in control and you'll know my name
'Cause I gave my life, gave it everything
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and bow down
Get on your knees and bow down
You better recognize
You wanna talk that shit, time to back it up
'Cause the best of your best ain't good enough
Playing with my name, now I know you really fucked up
Keep runnin' your mouth and I'ma call your bluff
You will never know, it's the price I pay
Look into my eyes, we are not the same
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
'Cause I'm in control and you'll know my name
'Cause I gave my life, gave it everything
Yeah, this is where you fall apart
Yeah, this is where you break
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and
You're never gonna be enough
So I had this dream
It meant everything
And I watched it come alive
Then I let you in
Underneath my skin
And I learned to love the lies
Now I lay awake and I contemplate
Have I become what I hate?
Can I take it back?
'Cause it's all I have
Will it get the best of me?
Have you ever had a dream?
Would you fight for it?
Would you go to war?
Would you die for it?
So now I'll take my stand
Now I'll make you see
That if you seek forgiveness
You'll get nothing from me
You'll get nothing from me
You'll get nothing from me
You'll get nothing from me
To everybody who doubted (to everybody who doubted)
To everybody who doubted
Get on your knees and bow down
Bow down
Bow down
I think I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking down
Hate, every single second, minute, hour every day
Person in the mirror, they won't let me feel a thing
Keep me focused on my problems, I'm addicted to the pain
(Everybody's out to get you)
I guess I never noticed, how it came creeping in
My enemy emotion, but I can't sink or swim
I say I'm feeling hopeless
They give me medicine
They give me medicine
They give me medicine
I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking
Down (I think I'm breaking)
Down (I think I'm breaking)
I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking down
Lies, every time they ask me, I just tell em that I'm fine
Try to hide my demons but they only multiply
Keep me runnin' from the voices on repeat inside my mind
(Everybody fucking hates you)
I guess I never noticed, how it came creeping in
My enemy emotion, but I can't sink or swim
I say I'm feeling hopeless
But no one's listening
But no one's listening
But no one's listening
I think I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking
Maybe it's in my blood
Got a pain that I can't avoid, I think I'm breaking
Down (I think I'm breaking)
Down (I think I'm breaking)
I think, I think too much
I'm a little bit paranoid, I think I'm breaking down
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I don't really like myself
I think I'm breaking down
I'm holding back right now
'Cause I'm numb to what's around
I miss the life I used to have with you right here
Now everything has turned to grey
And I'm blacking out the shades for now
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
Just a chance to catch my breath
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
'Cause it's all that I have left
When all I see are the memories, I don't want to lose a thing
Let me be sad, let me be sad
Can you see it in my eyes I've been distant?
'Cause I can't tell if it's the end or the beginning
I know I haven't been myself, I'll admit it
And I put up walls, so if I burned any bridges just know
I'm doing everything i can to try and fix it
But knowing me I'll probably miss it
These voices get so vicious
Feels like I'm rippin' stitches
I wish some days I could go back
Before life changed, it was so fast
That time is gone and I know that
So please
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
Just a chance to catch my breath
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
'Cause it's all that I have left
When all I see are the memories, I don't want to lose a thing
Let me be sad, let me be sad
I'm doing everything i can to try and fix it
But knowing me I'll probably miss it
These voices get so vicious
Feels like I'm rippin' stitches
I wish some days I could go back
Before life changed, it was so fast
That time is gone and I know that
All that we have is a moment
So please
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
Just a chance to catch my breath
Let me be sad
Even for a little while
'Cause it's all that I have left
When all I see are the memories, I don't want to lose a thing
Let me be sad, let me be sad
I'm holding back right now
(Let me be sad)
'Cause I'm numb to what's around
I miss the life I used to have with you right here
Now everything has turned to grey
And I'm blacking out the shades for now
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ay
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
"Oh, my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless (oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm (oh)
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (over)
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far (ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar (leave a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
On our knees we pray
As we waste away
And we dig our grave
Dead on arrival
I can't breathe
Got my head on the guillotine
Slipknot around my neck, come and take a seat
Watch 'em bury me down 'til I'm six feet deep
In the underground
Dead is the land of the free
Don't give, just take every time you need
Don't give, just take though it's killing me
Don't give, just take every time you need
Don't give, just take
On our knees we pray
As we waste away
And we dig our grave
Dead on arrival
In this mess we made
Fill our lungs with hate
Just to numb the pain
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
I can't breathe
I keep treadin' the water
Am I not worth saving?
But we're all goin' under
Am I not worth saving?
Don't give, just take every time you need
Don't give, just take though it's killing me
Don't give, just take every time you need
Don't give, just take
On our knees we pray
As we waste away
And we dig our grave
Dead on arrival
In this mess we made
Fill our lungs with hate
Just to numb the pain
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
I can't breathe
Am I not worth saving?
Am I not worth saving?
On our knees we pray
As we waste away
And we dig our grave
Dead on arrival
In this mess we made
Fill our lungs with hate
Just to numb the pain
Dead on arrival
Yeah
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
Dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, dead
Remember the moment you left me alone and
Broke every promise you ever made
I was an ocean, lost in the open
Nothin' could take the pain away
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne
The sticks and the stones that you used to throw have
Built me an empire, so don't even try
To cry me a river, 'cause I forgive you
You are the reason I still fight
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne
I'll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken
And now you know (know)
I'll leave you choking
On every word you left unspoken
Rebuild all that you've broken
And now you know
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne
So you can throw me to the wolves
Tomorrow I will come back
Leader of the whole pack
Beat me black and blue
Every wound will shape me
Every scar will build my throne.
