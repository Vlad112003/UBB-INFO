Idea: we will implement gradual exposure to different heights through an application that simulates hiking an mountain
Stages: we will get the player though different exposure levels:
	1. Ground level (easy)
	2. Climbing to the first checkpoint through a small forest, preparing
the player for the next stage
	3. Small cliffs overlooking the forest you've just walked through
	4. Narrow paths on the montain sides
	5. Wooden bridges between peaks
	6. Summit, calm place, the end
